		<h3>Meet the Hosts</h3>
		<p class="important">The voices you hear may just save your own.</p>
		
		<h4>Mars Norcana</h4>
		<p>Human</p>
		
		<h4>Segri</h4>
		<p>Half orc, half demon</p>
		
		<h4>Jamaerah</h4>
		<p>Angel</p>
		
		
		<h2>About Us</h2>
				
		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<p>No human ever truly likes to be alone; it's in our nature to crave societal relationships and bonds. To be forcefully deprived of that is torture, especially when you're adolescent.</p>
		<p>So why can't the same thing be said for fae? They talk like us, think like us, <em>feel</em> like us. That's what we're here for. Fae Thee Well is a podcast for the outcasts and misfits. The chipped and scrabbled. The wings and the dings. For people like you and me.</p>
		<p class="important"><a href="episode.html">The monster in your closet wants to be heard, will you listen?</a></p>
		
		<p>The hosts have been friends for a long time. They all realized that the media doesn't represent and gives voices to the supernatural and weird. Mars Norcana plans to infiltrate the industry to change that, with the help of Segri and Jamaerah of course.</p>
